  Enterprise Application Integration when Middleware is Overkill</strong></font><br>
  <font size="+1"><strong>Arthur Reyes, UTA<br>
  8 :30-9:30</strong></font> 
<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Enterprise application integration (EAI) 
  is cooperation of disparate systems and components to implement business rules 
  in a distributed environment. &quot;Systems and components&quot; can be computer-aided 
  design (CAD) or software engineering (CASE) tools, enterprise databases, COTS 
  applications, or in-house software. Ad hoc software interfacing (AHSI) is a 
  special kind of EAI. A tradeoff analysis classifies an EAI problem as an AHSI 
  problem when middleware solutions are seen as heavy-handed. I.e., the planned 
  EAI is not expected to become broad enough to justify the generality of a middleware 
  solution. AHSI seeks to &quot;wire&quot; extant software applications as components 
  in new, larger software applications. We call applications-as-components &quot;appliponents&quot;. 
  AHSI seeks to minimize recoding of appliponents to the greatest extent possible. 
  We demonstrate solutions to AHSI problems using XML toolkits, domain-specific 
  language toolkits, and Microsoft BizTalk Server.</p>

  9 :45-10:45</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Virtual environments (or VEs) are a powerful 
  option for visualizing and interacting with information, yet their widespread 
  adoption has been limited at least in part by the expense and difficulty of 
  producing complex and engaging VE applications. However, research is providing 
  tools and techniques for simplifying the production and management of VE experiences. 
  We will provide a review of recent advances in adaptive VEs, as well as discuss 
  potential applications of this technology to business, education, and entertainment.</p>
<p><strong><u>Biography</u></strong>: Karl Steiner is an assistant professor of 
  computer science at the University of North Texas. He has both a research and 
  professional background in Human-Computer Interaction, with particular interests 
  in Intelligent Interfaces for Virtual Environments, Computer Supported Collaborative

<p align="left"><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: The Internet is expected to 
  be employed to facilitate such applications as telemedicine, education, and 
  transportation, military all the time and everywhere. These applications demand 
  automated, continual unobtrusive services and proactive real-time collaborations 
  among devices and software agents in dynamic heterogeneous environments. The 
  existing push-/pull-based Internet and network model which is intended essentially 
  for static information services is inadequate to meet these requirements. In 
  this talk we present a novel framework based on communities of agents to enhance 
  the availability of Internet services to users and applications.</p>

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: With the advent of Web Services, many businesses 
  are looking into deploying Web Services as a component of their enterprise application 
  integration (EAI) strategy. Given the ease of development and deployment of 
  Web Services in the Microsoft .NET Framework, the Microsoft platform is being 
  considered more and more by businesses at the foundation of their EAI strategy. 
  However, savvy businesses are looking to the future to see how Web Services 
  can be exploited as a part of the larger business process. This session will 
  explore building solutions that automate business processes and integrate web 
  services utilizing BizTalk Server 2004 and the Microsoft .NET Framework.</p>

  With more and more mobile computing (from home to enterprise) users and companies 
  deploying wireless LANs (WLAN), security and access controls are the most often 
  abused, as the technology in place today is limited and easy to compromise. 
  There are a number of WLAN security standards being developed (led by IEEE 802.11 
  working groups), but they don't solve all the issues in an overall secure WLAN 
  architecture.</font>
<p>This session will cover security challenges of deploying a WLAN, client OS 
  capabilities of security access &amp; controls, the technologies used to meet 
  data privacy requirements of the WLAN, and methodologies used to safeguard network 
  integrity. In addition, there will be a real-time demonstration of an end-to-end 
  secure WLAN.</p>
