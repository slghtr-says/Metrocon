  <p class=MsoNormal><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Dramatic pictures of Jupiter, 
    Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, their rings, and their satellites were transmitted 
    to earth by the spacecraft Pioneer-10 and Pioneer-11 (1973-1979) and Voyager-1 
    and Voyager-2 (1979-1989). They were the culmination of one of the greatest 
    scientific and engineering efforts of our time. In this presentation, we not 
    only see some of these awe inspiring images, but we go behind the pictures 
    to see how they came to be; to learn how such spacecraft are created and what 
    makes them tick.</p>
  <p>During this presentation, we will build these spacecraft, launch them, and 
    marvel at the wonders they reveal. We ask the question, &quot;What does it 
    all signify?&quot; Is winning the race to space worth the concentrated investment 
    of resources, including those of our brightest and best minds? Will it give 
    our nation a competitive edge in the new millennium? Ultimately we may conclude 
    that these missions embody far more than just advances in science and technology. 
    Our observations may in fact lead us to understand that every area of human 
    activity stands in intimate relationship to them.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><strong><u>Biography:</u></strong> Dr. Ward retired from 
    Lincoln Laboratory after 42 years of distinguished service where he led or 
    participated in many projects, such as development of the Lincoln Experimental 
    Satellite Operations Center (LESOC). He is currently an IEEE Distinguished 
    Lecturer on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.</p>
  <p>Federally-funded, MIT Lincoln Laboratory's fundamental mission is to apply 
    science and advanced technology to critical problems of national security. 
    The scope of its projects includes space surveillance, missile defense, battlefield 
    surveillance and identification, communications, and air traffic control. 
    The Millstone Hill facility was the first radar to detect and track the Soviet 
    Sputnik satellites. The Lab continues to be a primary source of technological 
    innovation for military electronic systems. (source http://www.ll.mit.edu/about/history.html)</p>
  <p>Dr. Ward's projects included airborne-early-warning and ground-based surveillance 
    radars, space tracking and range instrumentation for NASA's Project Mercury, 
    and ballistic-missile testing. He developed solutions to problems of reliable 
    and secure satellite communication for both military and civilian customers. 
    He helped design, build, test and operate in orbit Lincoln Experimental Satellites 
    (LES) 5 and 6. He served as Associate Project Leader for LES 8 and 9. He also 
    participated in the development of the Extremely High Frequency Packages carried 
    by FLT Satellites 7 and 8, and in the creation of their Satellite Operations 
    Centers.</p>
  <p>Dr. Ward holds a BSEE from Texas A&amp;M, an MSEE from Caltech, and a PhD 
    (EE, Physics and Math) from Caltech. He is a member of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma 
    Xi, a Senior member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 
    and a Life Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics engineers. 
    He is a registered Professional Engineer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
    and a Member of the Massachusetts and the National Societies of Professional 
    Engineers, and of the Order of the Engineer.</p>
