<p align="center"><strong><font color="#0033FF" size="+2">Reverse Logistics Management</font></strong><br>
  <font size="+1"><strong>Laura Meade, Professor University of Dallas<br>
  8:30 -9:30</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: The selection of third-party logistics providers 
  is an intriguing practical and research question. Reverse logistics is increasingly 
  becoming an area of organizational competitive advantage, making the pursuit 
  of this function a strategic decision (Schwartz, 2000). With the development 
  and advancement of reverse logistics concepts and practice, the selection of 
  partners for the specific function of reverse logistics support becomes more 
  important. This paper is one of the first to address this issue. The factors 
  that play an important role in selecting a third-party reverse logistics provider; 
  such as a focus on end-of-life product organizational roles (e.g. recycling, 
  reuse, etc.), differ from some traditional factors for supplier selection. How 
  these new factors can be included for the selection of a partner is modeled 
  within a decision-making framework. The proposed approach uses a decision making 
  tool, based on the analytical network process model to aid in this selection 
  process.</p>

  Guide to Earned Value Metrics</strong></font><br>
  <font size="+1"><strong>Dennis Frailey, Principle Fellow at Raytheon Company 
  and Adjunct Professor SMU<br>
  1:30-3:00</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Do your projects suffer from the &quot;90% 
  done&quot; syndrome? How do you know how far you really are? Is your project 
  in trouble? How much trouble? How early in your project can you know? Can you 
  predict the likely outcome? Earned Value metrics enable practitioners and managers 
  to answer these questions based on facts. Unfortunately, earned value systems 
  are usually defined and explained by financial experts whose approach is full 
  of jargon and arcane terminology that leaves software people wishing they could 
  just get back to their workstation and start coding.</p>
<p>This presentation explains earned value in straightforward terms that make 
  sense to software developers and managers. The talk illustrates how to use earned 
  value to manage actual software development tasks.<br>
