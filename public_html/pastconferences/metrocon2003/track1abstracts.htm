<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Optical interferometry is an attractive measurement 
  technique due to its high resolution, large dynamic range, absolute calibration, 
  and non-contacting detection. Modern interferometers utilize fiber optics to 
  form robust systems for applications, which range from sensing the motion of 
  translation stages in atomic force microscopes to sensing the distributed strain 
  within the wing of an aircraft. In this paper, we review key aspects in the 
  implementation of an interferometer system and present experimental results 
  on two specific areas of application. The optical architecture and demodulation 
  scheme are key aspects of an interferometer that are inherently interrelated. 
  A common objective in interferometer design is the robustness of the system 
  to environmental perturbations unrelated to the signal of interest. This objective, 
  along with the form of the measurand, often dictates the optical configuration 
  and demodulation approach. A variety of two-beam interferometer architectures 
  and demodulation techniques will be reviewed. Particular emphasis will be placed 
  on demodulation schemes based on digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. 
  DSP-based demodulation schemes offer computational sophistication, real-time 
  operation, and system flexibility. The two application areas, which will be 
  presented, involve sensing the motion of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) 
  structures and the contraction of biological cell structures. Each of these 
  application areas has distinct system requirements that drive the interferometer 
  design. The background and motivation for these two applications will be presented 
  along with experimental results.</p>

  Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University where he conducted 
  research in fiber optic sensors for biomedical applications. From 1991 through

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: The introduction of advanced support concepts 
  in military systems like Prognostic Health Management (PHM) and Autonomic Logistics 
  has brought with it the need for a significant number of additional sensors. 
  Sensors in these sorts of applications are typically associated with non-mission 
  critical, low bandwidth data streams (environmental data, PHM precursors, etc). 
  Collection and distribution of these data streams with &quot;wired&quot; solutions 
  is impractical because of the associated costs, difficulty of installation, 
  reliability and weight impacts. While a wireless solution is clearly indicated, 
  RF energy-based solutions like BluetoothTM are often blocked by structural elements 
  in the aircraft and have a negative impact on aircraft electromagnetic compatibility 
  and signature. This presentation addresses a new wireless technology based on 
  digitally modulated ultrasonic energy that appears to offer significant promise 
  for the solution of this sensor integration problem. Challenges in the utilization 
  of this technology on an aircraft and potential technology solutions to these 
  challenges will be addressed. The presentation will end with a discussion of 
  potential synergistic commercial applications for this technology and future 
  plans for development of the technology in airborne weapon systems.</p>
<p><strong><u>Biography</u></strong>: Jim Houston is a Research and Development 
  Staff Specialist for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company. He is the Principle 
  Investigator for a R&amp;D project which is examining risk factors associated 
  with the utilization of COTS based avionics in military systems as well as potential 
  technologies which could mitigate these risks. He has been with GD/Lockheed 
  since 1976. He graduated with a MSEE from Oklahoma State University.<br>
