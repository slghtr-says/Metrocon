    <p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Nanoscale Science has provided us with 
      a flood of new technologies. We see their emergence in everything from fine-control 
      over the grain structure of materials to the application of genetic engineering 
      in food production. Automotive fuel cells, carbon-nanotube fibers, and biochips. 
      New products are emerging so rapidly that some become obsolete almost before 
      they can be brought to market. The problems of the venture capitalists have 
      become the problems of the corporate boardrooms. How can we maintain a competitive 
      product position in the face of such rapid obsolescence? What technologies 
      are important, and which can be safely ignored? Lessons can be learned from 
      Lucent and others, whose mistakes vershadow the business horizon. Failure 
      to wisely choose from the emerging technologies and then to engineer timely 
      upgrades to roducts and services, can result in a loss of customer confidence, 
      profits, and ultimately stockholder value. Mr. Smith observes that any existing 
      business models will be made obsolete-necessitating a total rethinking of 
      their business. On the other hand, many new opportunities will be enabled. 
      This presentation examines some of technology breakthroughs which have already 
      undergone Mr. Smith's strategic assessment of maturity and importance. These 
      investigations included new research and development in Material Science, 
      Systems Science, MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS), Photonics, Energy 
      Conversion, Networking, Systems Design, and Software Engineering. </p>
    <p> <u><strong>Biography</strong></u>: James T. Smith has over 20 years experience 
      in the development and fielding of advanced technical systems. Currently, 
      he is a Principal Member Research Staff with ISR (<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.isr.us','','toolbar=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')">http://www.isr.us</a>), 
      the Institute for Scientific Research in Fairmont, WV, where he is involved 
      in R&amp;D efforts in the development of artificial neural network-based 
      realtime control systems, and the emerging field of bioinformatics. He continues 
      to actively monitor the pulse of emerging technologies for ISR, and has 
      a newsletter that he distributes. He received his BS in Math and Physics 
      from Millsaps College and his MS in Math and Computer Science from the University 
      of Tennessee at Knoxville. He has done graduate work in engineering at Georgia 
      Institute of Technology, University of Mississippi, and the University of 
      Utah. His early work included design and development of classified and unclassified 
      Radar Algorithms at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, and expert systems 
      for the DARPA Pilot's Associate project at the Lockheed-Georgia Company. 
      He designed and developed a geographical reasoning system (GIS) for the 
      Lisp machine, and a system architecture and implementation approach for 
      an Airborne Cockpit Environment. He also designed and developed an Artificial 
      Intelligence toolkit which was successfully employed in the implementation 
      of a prototype for a NASA TDRS satellite ground terminal monitoring system. 
      Later, as a member of GTE's High Value Capabilities Definition &amp; Assessment 
      staff, Mr. Smith was involved in the development of completely new telecom 
      services and concepts. Projects included Advanced Intelligent Networks (AIN), 
      developing and testing the GTE Waltham laboratories/Bellcore Service Control 
      Point (SCP) platforms, Telecom'95 demonstrations, and development of the 
      Connected Family concept. This was a broadband-connected home and home-office 
      environment, which could interoperate as part of a new family of converged 
      services. Mr. Smith has published many internal and external documents. 
      He has just finished the material for a forthcoming John-WIley book, Communications 
      Services: The Technology of Call Control. Of particular interest, the strategic 
      document: &quot;Emerging Technologies and Trends? How Should GTE Respond?&quot; 
      is a 200+ page assessment of near-term technologies which is available from

    <p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: The MavHome Smart Home project is a multi-disciplinary 
      research project at the University of Texas at Arlington focused on the 
      creation of an intelligent home environment. Our approach is to view the 
      smart home as an intelligent agent that perceives its environment through 
      the use of sensors, and can act upon the environment through the use of 
      actuators. The home has certain overall goals, such as minimizing the cost 
      of maintaining the home and maximizing the comfort of its inhabitants. In 
      order to meet these goals, the house must be able to reason about and adapt 
      to provided information. In this presentation, I will discuss the MavHome 
      architecture and intelligent agent software that comprises the project. 
      Demos of current MavHome capabilities will be included, and the status of 
      the project will be updated.</p>

      </o:p></span>This research focuses on the design and experimental characterization 
      of two types of MEMS asymmetrical electrothermal microactuators. The motivation 
      is to present a description of the behavior of the electrothermal microactuator 
      to facilitate its adaptation to a variety of MEMS applications. Both MEMS 
      polysilicon electrothermal microactuator design variants use resistive (Joule) 
      heating to generate thermal expansion and movement. In a conventional electrothermal 
      microactuator, the &quot;hot&quot; arm is positioned parallel to a &quot;cold&quot; 
      arm, but since the &quot;hot&quot; arm is narrower than the &quot;cold&quot; 
      arm, the electrical resistance of the &quot;hot&quot; arm is larger. When 
      an electrical current passes through the microactuator (through the series 
      connected electrical resistance of the &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; 
      arms), the &quot;hot&quot; arm is heated to a higher temperature than the 
      &quot;cold&quot; arm. This temperature increase causes the &quot;hot&quot; 
      arm to expand along its length, thus forcing the tip of the device to rotate 
      about a mechanical flexure element. A new electrothermal actuator design 
      eliminates the parasitic electrical resistance of the &quot;cold&quot; arm 
      by incorporating an additional &quot;hot&quot; arm. The second &quot;hot&quot; 
      arm results in an improvement in electrical efficiency by providing an active 
      return current path. Additionally, the &quot;cold&quot; arm can now have 
      a narrower flexure compared to the conventional single- &quot;hot&quot; 
      arm device because it does not have to pass an electric current. A narrower 
      flexure element manifests improved mechanical efficiency. Deflection and 
      force measurements of both electrothermal actuators as a function of applied 
      electrical power are presented. Also described is the practical integration 
      of the electrothermal microactuators in a monolithic microengine that is 
      capable of bi-directionally translating a shuttle.</p>

    <p> <u><strong>Abstract</strong></u>: Communicationof useful information (such 
      as video E-mail and multimedia scenes comprising audio-visual objects, images, 
      and text) on the Internet is highly desirable for bringing leading-edge 
      technology for several industries, such as banking, manufacturing, tourism, 
      sales, entertainment and education. The development of such tools and systems 
      hinges upon a technology that should be standard and yet flexible, portable 
      and adaptive and yet secure, simple to deploy on present and future networking 
      infrastructures and still powerful enough to provide functionalities that 
      were previously inconceivable. This technology is MPEG-4, the new standard 
      developed by the Moving Pictures Experts Group of the International Organization 
      for Standardization for multimedia presentation, compression, and communications. 
      Three main features of MPEG-4 distinguish it from other technologies: object-based 
      nature, interactivity, and a high degree of compression. Our research groups 
      is one of the leading groups engaged in MPEG-4 research. Since the quality 
      of a compressed video generally depends on the bit-rate used during the 
      compression, the challenge is to simultaneously achieve the best possible 
      picture quality, highest compression ratio, and fastest encoding speed. 
      We have designed several new technqiues that collectively work to achieve 
      better quality at a given bit-rate or, alternatively, minimize the bit-rate 
      at a desired level of picture quality. In addition, we have built tools 
      for creation and display of full-scale MPEG-4 multimedia scenes. These tools 
      are compliant with existing formats but are more powerful than those currently 
      available.The interactive MPEG-4 Toolkit provides an environment for generating 
      MPEG-4 based multimedia sequences. Taking advantage of object-based structure 
      of MPEG-4, the authoring tool provides a wide range of functionalities to 
      a novice user for placing multimedia objects in a two dimensional spatial 
      environment with time as third dimension. These multimedia objects can be 
      audio and video clips or images, text, graphics, and animation. The scene 
      generated by the tool can be used as a multimedia presentation or a multimedia 
      document to be transmitted over the Internet as an E-mail message or downloadable 
      from a website. The MPEG-4 Authoring Tool is equipped with our efficient 
      MPEG-4 encoder and decoders producing high quality MPEG-4 sequences at very 
      low bit-rate and running at real-time speed on ordinary PCs. The audio and 
      other objects are also compressed with their relevant encoders included 
      in the scene and all of the compressed objects are multiplexed to generate 
      MPEG-4 compliant coded binary stream. This stream can be stored in an MP4 
      file for storage or transmitted over the Internet.</p>

      Reduction in product development cycle time and increased product quality 
      are the two key driving factors behind the development and use of Requirements

      verification and test process that allows early detection and elimination 
      of product defects and automatic generation of test cases using requirements 
      models. The use of Automated System/Software Test Environments supporting 
      these techniques significantly changes the current product development lifecycle 
      processes by helping eliminate manually intensive and error-prone requirements 
      and testing tasks. Requirements Testability analysis techniques provide 
      the capabilities to analyze requirement and design models to identify conflicting 
      product features prior to implementation. Test Automation techniques provide 
      for the automatic generation of test cases and identification of test coverage

    <p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Today&#8217;s businesses are grappling 
      with ever increasing account administration costs as the number of applications 
      and users continue to grow within an enterprise. To combat this problem, 
      many companies are turning to Identity management, which offers a business 
      strategy that can facilitate cost reduction, increased security, and centralization 
      of security policies, while offering enhanced user experience. Designed 
      around processes governing identity, access and workflow, an Identity Management 
      framework provides what a corporation needs to integrate current technologies 
      with a reliable management infrastructure, creating a more efficient and 
      productive account administration model. New technologies, trends and standards 
      continue to emerge that will greatly impact the Identity Management space. 
      Although these technologies and trends show promise, many challenges still 
      remain. As these technologies begin to mature, businesses must work to deploy 
      the technologies in a secure, evolutionary manner by integrating them with 
      existing identity and access management architectures.</p>

    <p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Developing mobile station (MS) location 
      technologies that meet the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 
      wireless E-911 requirement for emergency location has become an increasingly 
      important topic. The FCC has required that the carriers begin selling and 
      activating ALI (Automatic Location Identification)-capable handsets no later 
      than October 1, 2001 and has also granted a limited waiver of the accuracy 
      standards to certain carriers and the dead line is on September 1, 2002. 
      Since location information can potentially be used for other location-aware 
      applications, there is also an explosive interest in the development of 
      new location-based commercial services. In this talk, we are not only address 
      a summary of the location technologies that have potentially been used as 
      solutions to comply with the FCC E-911 mandate, but also discuss the emergence 
      of location commercial services and explore how mobile location information 
      can be used to (1) improve wireless system capacity and management and (2) 
      increase wireless system functionality for location commercial services. 
      Since location based information may be creating privacy threat to the mobile 
      users, many consumers are hesitant to expose themselves to new forms of 
      advertising. Therefore, we will give some thoughts on how to balance user's 
      privacy and business opportunity.</p>

      <strong><font size="+1">Part 2 - &quot;Power System Integration and Operational 
      Issues for Wind Energy&quot;<br>
      Robert M. Zavadil, Marketing Manager and Senior Consultant, Electrotek Concepts</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><u><strong>Abstract</strong></u>: This presentation will provide 
      a technical overview of modern commercial wind turbines and windplants, 
      and delve into current power system engineering topics and questions related 
      to wind energy. The presentation is composed of four parts:</p>
    <p><strong>Wind Turbine and Windplant Technology</strong>:</p>
    <p>Technology used to convert energy from the wind into electric power has 
      been evolving since the early 1980's. While the size of today's commercial 
      wind turbines now rivals those of concepts originally explored in early 
      government-funded R&amp;D projects, current designs owe more to the two 
      decades of experience and incremental technical progress in aerodynamic, 
      mechanical, and electrical engineering that has been gathered by turbine 
      designers, vendors, and windplant operators. Turbine types and technologies 
      in commercial operation will be discussed, along with important balance-of-plant 
      aspects that combine to constitute the 100 MW scale wind plants of today.</p>
    <p><strong>Interconnection and Operational Issues</strong>:</p>
    <p>The connection of a large windplant to the transmission system must not 
      compromise the performance or reliability of the resulting system. Unique 
      aspects of wind turbine technology and operation can pose challenges for 
      electrical design, and in some cases, current engineering practice can fall 
      short in addressing some of these technical questions. Issues related to 
      voltage regulation (both within and external to the wind plant), reactive 
      power planning and medium voltage system design will be discussed.</p>
    <p><strong>Integrating with Power System Operations</strong>:</p>
    <p>With wind now much more than a novelty or R&amp;D venture, questions concerning 
      impacts of windplants on power system operations, dispatch and scheduling 
      functions are becoming increasingly common. When a non-negligible fraction 
      of the generating resource in a control area is not directly dispatchable 
      or completely predictable, changes in operating practices and procedures 
      may be required. The consequences of those changes in terms of security, 
      reliability and economics will become increasing important for both wind 
      plant owners and control area operators going forward. The behavior of large 
      wind plants with respect to power system operations and control procedures 
      and the larger question of ancillary services will be discussed<br>
      here.</p>
    <p><strong>Augmenting Power System Engineering Practice</strong>:</p>
    <p>As has been the case with numerous other new technologies, much of the 
      understanding of specific system impacts, as well as benefits, is obtained 
      through various technical analyses and simulations performed by power system 
      engineers and analysts. In many of these evaluations, especially those focused 
      on technical questions, appropriate computer models are a requirement for 
      developing this general understanding of wind energy. Wind energy has emerged 
      quickly in many areas of the country, with the development of the necessary 
      analytical tools and characterizations lagging somewhat behind. The general 
      question of power system engineering practice as it relates to wind energy 
      will be discussed, along with some critical ground-breaking efforts aimed 
      at addressing this general need, such as the model development effort recently 
      initiated by ERCOT.</p>
    <p><strong><u>Biography</u></strong>: Robert M. Zavadil has been engaged in 
      R&amp;D and consulting activities related to renewable energy, especially 
      wind generation and photovoltaic power systems, since joining Electrotek 
      in 1989. He served as primary technical resource for a multi-year research 
      and development project for the EPRI Photovoltaics Program and was a member 
      of the international technical team for coordination of research, development,

      and provides technical and analytical services to wind turbine manufacturers 
      and wind plant operations for resolving electrical design and operating 
      problems. Serving as senior technical consultant on projects and studies 
      aimed at quantifying ancillary services issues for intermittent generation 
      technologies such as windplants and directs an Electrotek effort to develop 
      windplant models for appropriate for studies of transient and dynamic stability 
      of large power systems. Prior to joining Electrotek in 1989, Mr. Zavadil
