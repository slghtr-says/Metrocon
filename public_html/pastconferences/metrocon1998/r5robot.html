                <td>This year for the first time Region 5 is
                holding a robotics competition that is identical
                to one held each year at <a
                href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~robot/">Trinity
                College</a> in Hartford, Ct. The <a
                href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~robot/">Trinity
                College</a> contest has grown into an
                international event and it was the goal of the
                Region 5 Planning Committee to support the
                Trinity competition by sending the winning team
                of the Region 5 contest to Hartford to compete in
                their international competition. However due to
                scheduling conflicts, that will not be possible
                for the 1998 contest. The <a
                href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~robot/">Trinity
                College</a> contest is scheduled for the same
                weekend as the Region 5 contest. In spite of the
                scheduling conflict, IEEE Region 5 will still
                serve as a regional site for the <a
                href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~robot/">Trinity
                College</a> contest in 1998. This implies two
                things:<blockquote>
                    <p>1) the rules and regulations given below
                    are compatible with the <a
                    href="http://www.trincoll.edu/~robot/">Trinity
                    College</a> contest, and</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>2) the robotics competition will be open
                    to the public.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Note that the updated rules and regulations do
                not differ significantly from the previous rules
                and regulations. The main differences deal with

                <h4 align="left"><a name="1">1. CONTEST OBJECTIVE
                </a></h4>
                <p>To build a computer controlled Robot that can
                move through a model floor plan structure of a
                house, find a lit candle and then extinguish it
                in the shortest time subject to a few operating
                factors (see <a href="#15">Scoring</a>). This is
                meant to simulate the real-world operation of a
                Robot performing a fire security function in a
                actual home. The candle represents a fire which
                has started in the home and which the Robot must
                find and then extinguish. </p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="2">2. THE HOUSE FLOOR
                PLAN STRUCTURE AND FEATURES</a></h4>
                <p>The official floor plan structure contest area
                is shown in <a href="floor.gif">Figure 1</a>.
                This is what the contest structure will look
                like. This is not a maze contest where the Robot
                has to figure out how to move through the
                structure. The design of the structure will be
                known before hand (see <a href="floor.gif">Figure
                1</a>) and the goal is to find and extinguish the
                candle as quickly as possible. However, just like
                in the real world where there is always a measure
                of uncertainty in any information, the dimensions
                in the <a href="floor.gif">Figure 1</a> floor
                plan are approximations. The actual dimensions
                may vary up to as much as an inch from the given
                values. Welcome to operating Robots in the Real
                World.</p>
                <p>The walls of the structure will be made of
                wood and will be 13 inches high. The walls will
                be painted with flat white paint. The floor of
                the arena will be a smooth, wood surface painted
                with flat black latex paint. Any seams in the
                floor will be taped over and painted with the
                same flat black paint. As noted in the <a
                href="floor.gif">Figure 1</a> floor plan, all
                hallways and doorways to room will be 18 inches
                wide. There will not be a door in the doorways,
                just an 18 inch opening. There will be a white
                1&quot; wide line made with white tape or painted
                on the floor across each doorway to indicate the
                entrance to each room. The inner edge of the
                walls at the doorways (the inside of the door
                jam) may have a red rubber trim. </p>
                <p>The floor of the arena will be black. But just
                a note of warning that some Robots may use foam,
                power or other substances to attack the candle
                flame. Best efforts will be made to clean up
                after each Robot, but there is no guarantee that
                the floor will stay uniformly black throughout
                the entire contest. The floor may also have small
                (less then 1/8&quot; diameter) yellow dots on it
                to indicate the potential locations of candles
                and furniture. Unless you are operating in the
                Non-Dead-Reckoning mode (see <a href="#15">Scoring</a>),
                the floor will be level with no ramps or stairs. </p>
                <p>The Robot will start at the Home Circle
                location marked by the H in a circle on the arena
                floor plan (see <a href="floor.gif">Figure 1</a>).
                The actual Home Circle will be a solid white
                circle without the H painted on the floor. The
                12&quot; diameter white Home Circle will be in
                the center of the 18&quot; hallway, so there will
                be 3&quot; of space between the edge of the Home
                Circle and the walls. Therefore the center of the
                Home Circle will be 9&quot; from the either side
                wall. Notice that on the arena floor plan in
                Figure 1 there is a gap in the outer wall of the
                arena behind the Home Circle. This part of the
                wall is missing to allow contestants easier
                access to their Robots in setting them up, but a
                temporary wall can be put in this section if it
                helps the Robot's operation. Robots may also use
                any placement fixtures if they help the Robot
                initially align itself in the Home Circle. The
                Robot must start within the Home Circle, but once
                started, it can go in any direction desired and
                can go either horizontally or vertically in the
                diagram shown in <a href="floor.gif">Figure 1</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Some of the corners of the arena may have
                black, plastic connecting hardware which sticks
                out about 1/2 inch from the walls. These may be
                used to hold the arena structure together.</p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="3">3. ARENA LIGHTING</a></h4>
                <p align="left">The ambient light level in the
                contest area is impossible to determine until the
                actual day of the contest. Contestants will be
                given time on the contest day to make ambient
                light level readings if necessary to calibrate
                their Robot. The room will be lit by overhead
                high pressure sodium vapor lights. </p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="4">4. ROBOT OPERATION</a></h4>
                <p>Once turned on, the Robot must be
                self-controlled without any human intervention,
                that is, these are to be computer controlled and
                not manually controlled devices. </p>
                <p>The Robot can bump into or touch the walls of
                the arena as it travels, but it can not mark or
                damage the walls in doing so. However there will
                be a penalty for touching a wall. (See <a
                href="#18">Penalties</a>) The Robot can not leave
                anything behind as it travels through the arena.
                It can not make any marks on the floor of the
                arena that aid in navigation as it travels. Any
                Robot that deliberately, in the judges' opinion,
                damages the contest arena (including the walls)
                will be disqualified. This does not include any
                accidental marks or scratches made in moving
                around. </p>
                <p>The Robot must, in the opinion of the official
                judges, have found the candle before it attempts
                to put it out. The Robot can not just flood the
                arena structure with CO2 and put out the candle
                out by accident.</p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="5">5. PUTTING OUT THE
                CANDLE</a></h4>
                <p>The Robot must not use any destructive or
                dangerous methods to put out the candle. It can
                use such items as water, air, CO2, Halon, etc.,
                but any method or material that is dangerous or
                will damage the arena is prohibited. For example,
                the Robot can not explode a firecracker and put
                the candle out with the concussion. The Robot can
                not knock the candle over to put it out. </p>
                <p>It will be permissible to put out the candle
                by blowing air on it. Although this is not a very
                practical method of extinguishing a fire in the
                real world, it will be allowed in this contest. </p>
                <p>The candle can not be knocked over while it is
                still lit. If a Robot accidentally knocks over a
                candle after it has been put out, then the
                Robot's trial run will still count, but there
                will be a penalty. (See <a href="#18">Penalties</a>)
                The candle will be mounted on a wooden base so
                that it will not be easily knocked over by moving
                air or water. </p>
                <p>Any mess that a Robot makes (water, baking
                soda, whipped cream, etc.) in its effort to put
                out the candle will be cleaned up by the judges
                to the best of their ability between trials. </p>
                <p>Recent advances in the technology of
                extinguishing a candle have allow some Robots in
                past contests to put out the candle from more
                then 2 feet away. This ability to put out the
                candle from a relatively great distance runs
                contrary to the contest goal of building
                intelligent Robots that can truly find and zero
                in on a flame. To try to turn the contest back to
                its original track, the Robot must come within 12
                inches of the candle, before it attempts to
                extinguish the flame. There will be a white line
                (1 inch thick) in a 12 inch radius circle on the
                floor around the candle and the Robot must have
                some part of its body within the circle before it
                puts out the candle. The Robot can still shoot a
                jet of CO2, but it must do by having some part of
                its body within 12 inches of the candle. The
                12&quot; candle circle will NOT touch the white
                line at the doorway. Please see the Special
                Notices for any questions concerning this rule.</p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="6">6. ROBOT SIZE</a></h4>
                <p>The maximum size of the Robot shall be
                12.25&quot; by 12.25&quot; by 12.25&quot;. The
                Robot can not look over the walls of the
                structure and must never extend itself beyond
                12.25 inches in any dimension. All Robots will be
                carefully measured. Don't let your Robot be
                disqualified because it is slightly over the
                limit. </p>
                <p>If the Robot has feelers to sense an object or
                wall, the feelers must be counted as part of the
                Robot's dimensions and can not extend beyond
                12.25&quot; from side to side. </p>
                <p>If contestants want to add a flag, hat or
                other purely decorative, non-functional items to
                the Robot, they may do so as long as the item has
                absolutely no effect on the operation of the
                Robot.</p>

                <p align="left">There are no restrictions on the
                types of materials used in the construction of
                the Robot.</p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="9">9. THE CANDLE</a></h4>
                <p>The lit candle is supposed to represent a
                small house fire that the Robot is attempting to
                find and put out. The bottom of the candle flame
                will be between 6 and 8 inches off the floor.
                This height includes the height of the wooden
                candle support base. The bottom of the candle
                flame will start out at 8 inches above the floor
                and when in the course of the contest's many
                trials, it burns down to 6 inches above the
                floor, it will be replaced by a new candle. The
                candle used will be a standard approximately 1
                inch thick white candle. The flame will be
                visible from the side and not hidden by unmelted
                wax as with thick candles. The exact height and
                size of the flame is unknown and variable and
                will be determined by the specific conditions of
                candle and its surroundings. As along as the
                candle is within the specifications outlined
                above, the Robot is required to find the candle
                no matter what the size of the flame is at that
                particular moment. </p>
                <p>The candle will be placed at random in one of
                the room in the arena. The candle has an equal
                chance of being in any of the 4 rooms in each of
                the 3 trials that a Robot has. Hopefully the
                candle will be placed in different rooms in each
                trial to best test the Robot's operation, but it
                might be possible for the candle to be in the
                same room twice. If it happens that the candle is
                placed in the same room for both the 1st and 2nd
                trials, then we will make sure that it is not in
                that room for the 3rd and last trial. Thus every
                Robot will have the candle in at least 2 rooms
                &amp; maybe 3, during its 3 trials. </p>
                <p>The candle will not be placed in a hallway,
                but it might be placed just inside a doorway of a
                room. However the front of the Robot will be able
                to move at least 12 inches into the room before
                it encounters the candle. The locations of the
                candle used in last year's contest may not be the
                same used in this year's contest. </p>
                <p>The candle will be mounted on a wooden base
                (3&quot; x 3&quot; x 1.25&quot;) painted flat
                yellow. This base is used to keep the candle from
                tipping over easily. It will be possible to knock
                the candle over by bumping into it (which you
                don't want to do - see <a href="#18">Penalties</a>),
                but the candle will not fall over if it is merely
                hit by a stream of air or water.</p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="10">10. SENSORS</a></h4>
                <p>There is no restriction on the type of sensors
                that can be used as long as they do not violate
                any of the other rules or regulations. </p>
                <p>Contestants are not allowed to place any
                markers, beacons or reflectors on the walls or
                floors to aid in the Robot's navigation. </p>
                <p>Robot builders should be aware that many
                modern film and video cameras transmit infrared
                light as part of their automatic focusing
                systems. Ambient lighting in the contest room may
                also be a source of IR, visible and UV light. If
                a Robot uses light sensors to find the candle or
                detect walls or furniture, the builders should
                take steps to prevent these light sources from
                interfering with its operation.</p>

                <p align="left">The maximum electrical
                requirements for any system needing electrical
                connection will be 20 amps at 120 VAC. If your
                Robot or computer needs electricity - bring
                plenty of long grounded extension cords and
                outlet strips.</p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="12">12. CABLES</a></h4>
                <p align="left">If the Robot is connected to an
                external computer system for instructions and/or
                power make sure that the cable is long enough for
                the Robot to get to all areas of the arena. The
                cable can either be dragged behind the Robot as
                it travels through the structure or it can be
                held above the walls by one of the impartial
                contest officials.</p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="13">13. THE ORDER OF
                RUNNING</a></h4>
                <p>The Robots will be randomly assigned numbers
                to determine the order in which they will compete
                in the contest. Each Robot will make a run in the
                arena in the order in which it is assigned. After
                every Robot has made its first run, then the
                whole process will begin again for the second
                run. In other words, the Robots will compete
                consecutively and when everyone is done with
                their first attempt, then the whole process will
                repeat for the second and finally third attempts.
                </p>
                <p>Contestants will have time between their runs
                to make any adjustments, modifications or repairs
                to their Robot, but once the Robot before them
                has completed its run, then they will have 1
                minute to get their Robot in the arena and
                started on its run. Any Robot that is not ready
                to run after 1 minute will forfeit it's chance at
                that trial. It may still compete in any other
                runs that are left. Once assigned, the order of
                running will not be changed. If you are not
                ready, then you've missed your turn. The time
                between turns is undetermined and is controlled
                by how long the other competitors take to
                complete their runs. </p>
                <p>Once the Robot is ready, the location of the
                candle and any furniture, if necessary, shall be
                determined and the candle and the furniture shall
                be put in the proper locations. </p>
                <p>The contestants will show a judge how to
                actuate the Robot and then the judge will
                actually press whatever buttons necessary to
                start the Robot.</p>
                <h4><a name="14">14. TWO DIFFERENT DIVISIONS</a></h4>
                <p>There will be two different divisions. An IEEE
                Student division and an Open division for the
                general public. There will be awards and prizes
                given for both divisions. </p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="15">15. SCORING</a></h4>
                <p>The Robot with the lowest operating score will
                be the winner. There are 4 different factors
                which can effect the final score depending on
                which of the operating modes the contestants
                choose for their Robot. The Operating Score (OS)
                will be determined by multiplying the Time Score
                (TS) by the Operating Mode Factors. </p>
                <p>The basic method of determining the Operating
                Score is running in the Standard Operation. There
                are then 4 factors which can reduce the Time
                Score to give a lower Operating Score. They are
                the Sound Activation, Return Trip, Furniture
                modes and Non-Dead-Reckoning.</p>

                        self-contained computer. The Robot
                        operates in the arena structure with no
                        obstructions other than the walls. The
                        Robot is activated (starts to search for
                        the candle) by manually starting it.
                        After finding the candle and
                        extinguishing it, the Robot stays where
                        it is. In this mode, the time in seconds
                        for the Robot to find and extinguish the
                        candle is the operating score. The

                        Radio Shack #273-075 in continuous mode).
                        Once turned on, the Robot can not start

                        return to the Home Circle, the Robot
                        would not be disqualified. Instead we

                        <p>Many Robots use a form of
                        dead-reckoning to travel through the
                        arena. That is, once correctly oriented
                        at the start of the arena, they count the
                        distance moved and angle turned and add
                        them to their old position to obtain
                        their new location and orientation. While
                        this is a perfectly good and legitimate
                        method of traveling through the arena in
                        this contest, it is not as practical or
                        useful in the real world. So to encourage
                        Robots to use more sophisticated methods
                        of determining their position within the
                        arena, we are giving a score reduction
                        bonus to Robots that do not use a

                        <p>The key to using dead-reckoning is
                        knowing the distance before-hand to the
                        various rooms in the arena. If you decide
                        to run your Robot in this

                        one or more inclined sections in the
                        hallways of the arena which will have the
                        effect of changing the distance to the

                        <p>An inclined section will be placed in

                        wide, completely filling the hallway. It
                        will have gently sloped sides. Because of
                        the sloped sides, the total distant a
                        Robot travels in going over the inclined
                        section will be greater then if it just
                        went on the flat floor, thus limiting the
                        effectiveness of dead-reckoning. The
                        slope may be such that a wheel on one
                        side of the Robot may travel a greater
                        distance then a wheel on the other side.
                        Since the robot will not know exactly
                        where this increased path will be placed,
                        it will have to use other methods besides
                        dead reckoning to determine its location
                        and orientation within the arena. </p>
                        <p>There may be more then one inclined
                        section used during a trial. The section
                        will only be used in hallways and not in
                        rooms. A section will not be placed in a
                        doorway and will not block a doorway. The
                        number and location of the sections will
                        be changed from trial to trail if this
                        mode is selected. The sections will
                        remain in place during the return trip
                        portion of the trial. The maximum height
                        of the inclined section will be less than
                        2 inches. The inclined sections will be
                        tapered and there will be as smooth an
                        intersection with the flat floor as
                        possible. There will NOT be any steps or
                        sharp drops. The exact dimensions of the
                        inclined section will be unknown to the
                        Robot before the start of the contest.
                        The maximum slope of the incline will be
                        13 degrees. The wooden inclined sections
                        will be painted flat black just like the
                        floor. Successfully operating in this
                        mode will result in a 30% reduction in
                        the time score. ( OS = .70 x TS )</p>

                    <li><p align="left"><strong>Furniture</strong></p>
                        <p>In this mode there will be one piece
                        of furniture in each room. The furniture
                        will be placed at random in the rooms.
                        The Robot may touch the furniture, but it
                        can not push or damage the pieces. The
                        furniture will be represented by 4.5 inch
                        diameter steel cylinders, painted
                        semi-gloss yellow. The cylinders are 12
                        inches high and weigh 5 pounds. </p>
                        <p>The possibility that the furniture may
                        be blocking the Robot's view of the
                        candle or that the Robot may have to go
                        around the furniture to get to the candle
                        is what makes the Furniture Mode such an
                        interesting and real-world realistic
                        challenge. The Robot may have to look
                        around the room from different locations
                        to see if the furniture is really
                        blocking it's view of the candle and if
                        the candle is indeed behind the
                        furniture, the Robot may have to
                        determine what is the best way to go
                        around the furniture to get to the
                        candle. Successfully operating in this
                        mode will result in a 30% reduction in

                <h4 align="left"><a name="16">16. SCORING
                EXAMPLES </a></h4>
                <p>If Robot A competes in the Standard Mode and
                puts out the candle in 1 minutes and 20 seconds,
                the operating score would be the time in seconds
                or 80. </p>
                <p>If Robot B competes in the Sound Activation
                Mode and puts out the candle in 1 minutes and 22
                seconds then its operating score would be the
                time in seconds less 5% for being in the Sound
                Activation Mode or .95 x 82 or 78. </p>
                <p>If Robot C competes in the Furniture Mode and
                puts out the candle in 1 minute and 47 seconds
                then its score will be the time in seconds less
                30% for operating in the Furniture Mode or .7 x
                107 or 75. </p>
                <p>Thus in this example, Robot C would have the
                best score even though it took the longest actual
                time. Robot B would be second and Robot A would
                be third. </p>
                <p>It will also be possible to combine modes.
                Thus if Robot D operated in the Sound and Return
                Trip mode its score would be (.95 x .90) or 85.5%
                of its actual time in seconds. ( OS = .95 x .90 x
                TS ) </p>
                <p>This scoring procedure is designed to try to
                allow Robot entries of all different levels of
                sophistication to compete in the same contest.
                Anyone can win. </p>
                <p>Each Robot will have 3 chances to find and
                extinguish the candle. The Robot can operate
                under different modes during each trial. The
                candle and any furniture, if necessary, will be
                moved to different locations for each trial. The
                lowest total of the two best scores from the
                three trials shall be used to determine the
                winner. A Robot must successfully extinguish the
                candle in order to have completed a run and get a
                score. A Robot must have at least two completed
                runs and the associated scores in order to be
                eligible for a prize. In other words, a Robot
                must have put the candle out at least twice in
                order to win a prize. One really, really good
                score will not be enough. </p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="17">17. TIME LIMITS </a></h4>
                <p align="left">In order to achieve the contest
                objective of building a Robot that can find and
                extinguish a fire in a house, finding the fire
                within a reasonable period of time is very
                important. The maximum time limit for a Robot to
                find the candle will be 6 minutes. After 6
                minutes the trial will be stopped. The maximum
                time for the Robot to return to the Home circle
                in the Return Trip mode will be 3 minutes. If in
                any trail, a Robot gets stuck in a loop and
                performs the same movement 5 times in a row, that
                trial will be stopped. Any time the Robot does
                not move at all for 1 minute, the trial will be
                stopped. Any trial that is stopped will count as
                no score for that Robot. Stopping a trial run for
                any of the above reasons will have no impact on
                any of the other two trial runs that the Robot
                has.</p>
                <h4 align="left"><a name="18">18. PENALTIES </a></h4>
                <p align="left">The goal of this contest is to be
                as real-world realistic as possible. Therefore
                there are two actions while not illegal, are not
                what would be a good operating method in the real
                world. Thus there are penalty points added to the
                time score (TS) of any Robot which does them. You
                can still do these things, but you will get
                points added to your time score (TS) if you do.
                Don't let these penalties scare you too much.
                These penalties are generally a small price to
                pay for a Robot actually manages to accomplish
                the task. </p>

                        <p align="left">Any Robot that touches a
                        wall with any part of its body or feeler,
                        either deliberately or accidentally will
                        have 5 points added to its time score
                        (TS) for each time it touched a wall. Any
                        Robot that slides along a wall will have
                        an additional 1 point added to its time
                        score for each inch of wall it touched as
                        it was sliding along. A Robot can still
                        touch a wall to orient itself, but it
                        will be penalized for doing so.</p>

                        whether the candle is lit or
                        extinguished. This touching refers only
                        to a part of the Robot's body and does
                        not include any water, air or other

                <p align="left">Since it is important that any
                Fire-Fighting Robot be reliable as well as fast,
                any Robot that extinguishes the candle in all
                three of its trials will get a 10% reduction in
                its Final Score (The sum of its two best
                Operating Scores.) For example, Robot A has
                Operating Scores of 25 and 24, but failed to
                extinguish the candle in its third trial. Robot B
                has Operating Scores of 28, 24 &amp; 47. The two
                best Operating Scores for Robot A added together
                give Robot A a final score of 49. The two best
                Operating Scores for Robot B total 52, but since
                it extinguished the candle in all 3 trials, it
                gets a 10% reduction in the Operating Score total
                so its Final Score would be 46.8 and Robot B
                would beat Robot A. </p>

                QUALIFICATIONS</a></h4>
                <p>In the event that there are a large number of
                entries it may be necessary to prequalify your
                robot. A decision will be made one month before
                Region 5 Conference whether prequalification will
                be necessary. Prequalification would run on
                Friday afternoon before the actual contest on
                Saturday. If prequalification is necessary, then
                the following guidelines will be used.</p>
                <p>In order to qualify for the contest a Robot
                must be able to find and extinguish a candle
                within the 6 minute time limit. As part of this
                qualification test, the Robot builders,
                themselves, can place the candle in any room and
                in any location within that room of their
                choosing. If the Robot finds the candle, then it
                passes the preliminary qualification test and can
                compete in the contest on Saturday. </p>
                <p>The time that it takes the Robot to find and
                extinguish the flame during the qualification
                test will not count in any way towards its score
                in the actual contest. The Robot can make as many
                attempts at qualifying for the contest as the
                time and schedule during the practice sessions on
                Friday permit. The Robot only needs to have found
                and extinguished a candle once in order to be
                qualified for the contest. </p>

                than one Robot can be entered by any individual
                or group, but each entry must be accompanied by a
                $20 fee. The same physical Robot can not be
                entered twice even if two entry fees are paid. If
                you want to enter two Robots, then you must build
                two Robots. Please make the checks payable to
                IEEE Region 5 Conference and include the check
                with the entry form. Send the $20 check and the
                completed entry form to:</p>
