<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> Entrepreneuring, outsourcing, internal business
units. The concept of the &quot;virtual organization&quot; is already creating
new opportunities and defining new ways of doing business. After the year
2000, successful engineers may need to have much in common with successful
entrepreneurs. Optimistic about the future and about engineering, Michael
shares some of his secrets for New Age survival. With this knowledge, perhaps
we can avoid the harder lessons he learned along the way.</DT>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> By any standards, ancient Egyptians were very
successful in solving complex engineering problems. These highly innovative
people lacked iron and steel, had no huge earth-moving machinery, did not
operate lifting or cutting equipment using electric power, and performed
their work without that mainstay of modern engineering - the computer.
In spite of this, they built pyramids and temples that remain the marvel
of both ancient and modern worlds.<BR>
<BR>
</DT>

<DT>Engineering is almost always about solving difficult problems. It is
about innovative thinking in the use of resources. This overview surveys
some of the technical barriers that faced the ancient Egyptians and shows
how they built a complex society using alternative solutions.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Biography</U>:</B> With over 20 years of experience, Dr. Ossian has
led project teams in Gabon, Congo (West Africa), the eastern Java Sea (Indonesia),
China (P.R.C.), Eastern Canada, Alaska North Slope, Texas and Louisiana.
He has conducted seminars in China and published over 55 papers on geology,
botany, and Egyptology. He is currently writing a book on Egyptology.<BR>
<BR>
</DT>

<DT>Dr. Ossian is a member of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science and is a Fellow of Sigma Xi National Scientific Honors Society.
He is President, North Texas Chapter-American Research Center in Egypt
and a member of the Egyptian Exploration Society.<BR>
<BR>
</DT>

<DT>Current and former activities include consulting as President, The
OSSIAN Group; teaching as a Faculty Member, Tarrant County Junior College;
studies and projects as a Certified Principal Research Geologist for the
ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY. He is a member of the American Orchid and Paleontological
Societies.<BR>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> A perspective for understanding the engineering
of today is carefully built upon a framework of historical accomplishments.
This presentation plunges us headlong into facing some of the hardest questions
of our times. What challenges await our brightest and best as we enter
the 21st century? What new products will be produced? Will new materials,
new methods, and new tools change the way we do engineering? What engineering
skills will be most valued? An exciting aural-visual excursion into the
future!<BR>
