<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> Electrical engineers tend to develop their
expertise with pencil and paper, or nowadays, with the computer, oblivious
to the fact that electricity kills and injures thousands of users every
year. Yes, electricity can be a very dangerous byproduct of our modern
technology. This presentation will focus on the design, procedural, and
regulatory aspects of safe electrical engineering. A summary of the various
hazards of electricity will be presented relative to consumer products,
electrical generation and transmission, and electricity in the R&amp;D
laboratory. <BR>
<B><U>Biography</U>:</B> Dr. Gordon graduated with his Ph.D. in EE in 1981
from Texas Tech University. He worked for the Department of Energy at Lawrence
Livermore National Labs, at Auburn Univerisity, and is currently a member
of the faculty of Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at
Arlington. His fields of research include pulsed power, dielectric materials,
compact power sources, space power, and electrical safety. As a result
of working with very dangerous forms of electrical energy he has been involved,
for 15 years, in promoting and teaching in electrical safety. He has lectured
to, and trained over 15,000 R&amp;D electrical workers and has a working
knowledge of most all aspects of electrical safety from consumer safety
(e.g., UL), government requirements (e.g., OSHA), professional guidelines
(e.g., IEEE's NESC), and laboratory safety. </DT>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> The quality of short term hourly load forecasts
with lead times ranging from one hour to several days ahead has a significant
impact on the efficiency of the operation of any electric utility since
many potentially costly decisions such as economic scheduling of generating
capacity, scheduling of fuel purchases, system security assessment, and
planning for energy transactions are based on such forecasts. The importance
of accurate load forecasts will increase in the future because of dramatic
changes occurring in the structure of the electric utility industry due
to deregulation and competition. This environment compels the utilities
to operate at the highest possible efficiency which, as indicate above,
requires accurate load forecasts.<BR>
<BR>
</DT>

<DT>In this session, we will discuss a highly successful artificial neural
network (ANN) based short term hourly load forecaster known as &quot;ANNSTLF.&quot;
ANNSTLF which has been developed for the Electric Power Research Institute
is the premier load forecasting program in the nation with over 40 users.
The details of the forecasting engine, features of the program, and results
of performance studies will be presented.</DT>

<DT><B><U>Biography</U>:</B> Alireza Khotanzad received the Ph.D. degree
in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana,
in 1983. He joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering
at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, in 1984, where he is currently
an Associate Professor. Dr. Khotanzad's research interests include artificial
neural networks and their applications to various forecasting problems,
pattern recognition, and signal and image processing. He is an Associate
Editor for Pattern Recognition and served as an Associate Editor for the
IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks from 1995 to 1997.<BR>

</DT>

<DT>Dr. Khotanzad received the SMU School of of Engineering and Applied
Science Outstanding Graduate Professor Award in 1993 and 1996. He also
was the recipient of the SMU Sigma Xi Outstanding Faculty Research Award
in 1995. He was elected as the IEEE Dallas Section Engineer of the Year
in 1998. He is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Texas.

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> This talk will cover power distribution issues
in the design of industrial facilities and municipal facilities. The art
of selecting a distribution system for a facility will be discussed, and
the various considerations will be presented:&nbsp;Type of system ( radial,
loop etc.), Voltage (15 kV, 600 volt etc.), Protection (relaying, fuses,
coordination etc.).</DT>

<DT><B><U>Biography</U>:</B> Mr. Safford is responsible for all electrical
engineering and design for projects performed in the Dallas, San Antonio,
Houston, and Ft. Worth offices of Black &amp; Veatch.&nbsp; His work has
included design of municipal and industrial facilities. &nbsp;Mr. Safford
is experienced in the design of high, medium, and low voltage distribution
systems: co-generation; SCADA and control systems: emergency power systems;
lighting systems; hazardous area applications; and electrical systems studies.
&nbsp;Mr. Safford has a BSEE degree from UT El Paso, is a licensed Professional
Engineer in Texas, Mississippi, &amp; Oklahoma, and has worked for Black
&amp; Veatch since 1985.<BR>
