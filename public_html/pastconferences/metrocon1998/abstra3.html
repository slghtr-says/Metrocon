<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> Research in distributed computing continues
on many fronts. Unlike parallel processing, where current use is limited
to a small number of highly specialized applications, networks of computers
are an essential part of almost everyone's daily life. There is an extremely
lively and developing industry is software for which the raison d'etre
is the network. These range from distributed databases, to mobile packet
radio networks in which radios communicate peer-to-peer in a dynamically
changing network that have no base stations, to mobile agents that move
around on the internet gathering data on web-sites and the presence of
specialized expertise. All of this in spite of the fact that many open
problems remain at the fundamental research level, and the number of impossibility
results continues to grow.<BR>
<BR>
</DT>

<DT>From Dijkstra's early introduction of the Dining Philosophers Problem
in 1968 through to the present day, researchers have been intrigued by
algorithms that exist on distributed computer systems, communicating only
by messages, working together to solve problems. Such algorithms must tolerate
errors and losses in the message passing system, and even be resilient
to failures in the processors, links, and the software components running
in the processors. Add to these daunting requirements the need for dynamic
networks, ones in which processors and precosses are added or deleted in
real time, and the network topology can also change arbitrarily without
warning, and you get some feel for the challenges facing the field.<BR>
<BR>
</DT>

<DT>In this talk, we will survey important results in the field and then
look at one example, Mobile Packet Radio Networks, which seems to embody
some of the most difficult challenges to date.</DT>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> As more and more companies maintain large volumes
of data related to their resources and customers, the need has developed
to automatically analyze this data in search of knowledge that can increase
their competetiveness. Data mining is the search for valuable knowledge
in large volumes of data. This tutorial will both describe and demonstrate
the data mining techniques used to perform this search. We will also describe
data mining's role in the larger process of knowledge discovery in databases,
which also includes data preparation, data reduction and knowledge evaluation.</DT>
