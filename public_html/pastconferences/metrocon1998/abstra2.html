<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> As the devices scale down, even though the
absolute noise magnitude gets smaller, since the voltages also scale down,
the signal-to-noise ratio decreases. Noise models developed for large area
devices based on the large-number-electron averaging theories break down.
In addition, in sub-micron devices, as the device dimensions approach electron
mean-free path, quantum effects start to play an important role. Since
noise has important implications on the reliability and performance of
the device, beyond a certain limit of scaling down, with existing models,
it becomes impossible to predict the noise performance of an individual
transistor, specifically a MOSFET. The lack of accurate models leads the
process and circuit designer either to adapt large area-transistor models
with high errors or to use a trial-and-error method leading to significant
waste of valuable time. As the Semiconductor Research Corporation has correctly
concluded last year, there is an urgent need to measure, analyze, and model
the noise characteristics of next generation sub-micron transistors. This
talk will focus on the research activities currently underway at SMU on
characterization and modeling of sub-micron MOSFET noise behavior.<BR>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> In the present and future engineering environments,
we are, and will continue to encounter the challenge to address growing
technological complexity while reducing costs. Re-sponses to this situation
include shrinking design cycles to achieve shorter time-to-market with
design goals for smaller, less massive and more reliable products. Innovative
efforts in micro- and nano-scale technologies are on the leading edge of
this progress. Dr. Kolesar will introduce the foundations of MEMS technology,
including fundamental fabrication principles, materials, and design tools,
leading to a discussion of the principal market areas for inserting MEMS
technology and several recent commercial successes. Additionally, the significant
results achieved with the TCU MEMS devices will be ad-dressed. The forward-thinking
engineer will catch insights for his own possibilities and grasp what is
required to become an active participant with this new technology. <BR>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> The role of nonlinear optics in enhancing optical
technologies continues to expand. In particular, second order processes
have been developed for frequency conversion, optical switching, parametric
oscillation and amplification, and other applications. This presentation
will focus on second harmonic generation (SHG) and all-optical switching.
For SHG, the interest is on the amount of fundamental power that is converted
to the second harmonic frequency, a process which requires phase-matching
between these two waves. All-optical switching requires a nonlinear phase
shift of the fundamental wave. Cascading is one process by which to produce
the required nonlinear phase shift. Energy is converted back-and-forth
between the fundamental and second harmonic waves, typically away from
the phase-match condition. <BR>
<BR>
</DT>

<DT>First, a basic overview of second order nonlinear optical processes
will be given, followed by current research at UT Arlington. Nonlinear
waveguides for frequency conversion are under development based on an anomalous
dispersion phase-matching technique in organic polymers. The idea of cascading
is being implemented in a new counterpropagating quasi-phase-matching configuration.
This structure can be used for efficient frequency conversion or for producing
nonlinear phase shifts by adjusting the physical design parameters.</DT>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> A technique for making internal mirrors in
optical fibers forms the basis for a new class of sensors with the fiber
Fabry Perot interferometer (FFPI) as the active element. In extensive field
tests, these sensors have been used to measure gas pressure in internal
combustion engines, liquid pressure in pumps, and strain in civil structures.
The fiber optic sensors have shown an unprecedented combination of high
sensitivity, ability to endure extreme temperatures, and immunity from
electromagnetic interference. </DT>

Integrated optics is concerned with the development of thin-film components
for performing functions such as modulation, switching, and multiplexing
of guided light beams. Much of the research is oriented towards applications
in optical fiber communications, a field in which technology is evolving
rapidly to keep pace with seemingly insatiable demands for bandwidth. We
are exploring new materials and fabrication techniques for integrated optical
waveguides as well as the demonstration of new device concepts; e. g.,
tunable add-drop filters for swavelength division multiplexing.</DT>
