<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> This paper presents a method of directional
frequency reuse for high density, high capacity cellular networks. Unlike
the classical method of cluster reuse, the proposed directional frequency
reuse is based on group reuse, having multiple reuse distances. Consequently,
the carrier to interference ratio (C/I) appears as a function of multiple
reuse distances with fewer cochannel interferers. Moreover, antenna downtilt
and beamwidth becomes more effective thus enhancing C/I and capacity.<BR>

<P><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> W-CDMA is a preferential CAI since it provides
significant immunity to multpath fading. However, in a multpath access
mode, the capacity of a CDMA system is limited by the lack of orthogonality
of the received transmissions from the users terminals and the resulting
near-far problem. TDMA is a time-orthogonal system, which, when spread,
provides both orthogonality, as well as, immunity to multipath. This paper
compares a wireless system employing W-CDMA transmissions from terminal-to-base
and from base-to-terminal, with a novel system which employs spread-TDMA
transmission from terminal-to-base and W-CDMA transmission from base-to-terminal,
thereby providing optimum performance in both directions.</P>

<P>The systems are compared on the basis of capacity in a multipath, multiple
cell, environment and on the basis of complexity. The spread spectrum receivers
employed in both systems employ matched filters which permit connectionless
as well as connection based packet switched communications.<BR>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> This talk presents a practical treatment of
the methods, trade-offs, and design of a CDMA PCS direct sequence spread
spectrum signal receiver. The talk includes a walk-through of how a narrow
band signal is recovered from a wideband signal, the Hadamard transform
process, the multi-channel rake receiver, and how the deinterleaving and
decoding blocks all work and play together to provide clear reception of
a faded subscriber signal.</DT>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> In this talk, short-term fading problems in
mobile communications are characterized and mitigation techniques are presented.
The effect of multipath, delay spread, coherence bandwidth, Doppler shift,
Doppler spread, and coherence time are presented and discussed. The different
types of short-term fading: flat &amp; frequency selective fading, and
slow &amp; fast fading are also presented. The mitigation techniques to
combat fading are then discussed, including time diversity (equalization),
multipath (rake), and space (antennas).<BR>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> Optical communications will enable radical
changes within future transport networks. This presentation examines the
main options and issues towards the design and implementation of telecommunication
optical core networks based on multi-wavelength transmission and routing.
After a short introduction, addressing essentially the context for the
adoption of optical techniques to implement routing functions, the node
functional requirements (different optical cross-connects and add-drop
multiplexers) are then illustrated, and this introduces also the relationships
between the node and network functional architectures, which affect the
design phase and the management techniques. This design must ensure proper
allocation of resources and network survivability, together with engineering
rules to ensure physical feasibility. Finally some technological and experimental
results are given as examples to show feasibility of the concepts. <BR>

<DT><B><U>Abstract:</U></B> As the basic telecommunications paradigm shifts
from one centered onseparate voice and data networks to a focus on developing
ubiquitousmultimedia communications, we are faced with the challenge of
providingexceptional quality of service (QoS) and seamless user connectivity
over avast array of heterogeneous networks. Low rate wireless communicationsoffers
some of the greatest difficulties because of the unreliable natureof the
transmission medium, the need to conserve battery power, and therestricted
bandwidth available. We first examine the issues in thetransmission of
voice signals over mobile connections at 8 kbits/s andbelow, with particular
emphasis on the speech coder design, unequal errorprotection, and the effects
of background impairments. We then address theproblem of wireless video
transmission at 28.8 kbits/s, exploring a newmultiframe block motion compensation
technique. Audio and videodemonstrations will be presented.<BR>
