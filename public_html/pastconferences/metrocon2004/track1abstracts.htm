  <p align="left"> <u><strong>Abstract</strong></u>: Based on the results of a 
    two-day DACUM (develop a curriculum) focus group attended by a panel of thirteen 
    noted fuel cell technology experts from across the nation, a curriculum has 
    been developed and presented for approval by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating 
    Board (THECB). The objective of the two-year Fuel Cell Maintenance and Repair 
    Technician program is to provide the graduate with hands-on training and education 
    in fuel system theory, operation, installation, maintenance, troubleshooting 
    and repair. The program includes 72 credit hours of extensive classroom and 
    &#8220;hands on&#8221; laboratory experience with stationary fuel cells designed 
    for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Successful graduates 
    will receive an Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree, and will be 
    prepared to enter the workforce with working background in a wide range of 
    fuel cell types and applications.</p>
  <p align="left">Fuel cells range from palm-sized milliwatt devices to large 
    industrial systems producing megawatts of electrical power for manufacturing, 
    to commercial distributed generation applications, and powering single homes 
    that are both grid connected and grid independent. The majority of fuel cells 
    that operate on hydrogen produce very little or no harmful pollutants. Fuel 
    cell systems produce DC and can export AC electrical power if an inverter 
    is used. Most fuel cells also produce highly useful by-products of heat and 
    pure water.</p>
  <p align="left">There is little need for fuel cell technicians in Texas presently, 
    due primarily to equipment costs. However, within three to five years, the 
    use of stationary fuel cell systems (as well as demand for qualified fuel 
    cell technicians) is expected to grow at an exponential rate. Predictions 
    indicate demand for fuel cell systems will increase as the costs of equipment 
    is reduced, the cost of fossil fuels increase, and mandates for higher efficiencies 
    and lower emissions.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong><u>Biography</u></strong>: Sidney Bolfing, an Electrical/Computerized 
    Control Systems and Robotics senior instructor at TSTC Waco, is the project 
    coordinator for fuel cell curriculum development at Texas State Technical 
    College Waco. As chairman of the Texas Fuel Cell Technology Consortium (TFCTC), 
    he has been instrumental in leading fuel cell curriculum development for two-year 
    colleges dedicated to producing qualified fuel cell technicians for the state 
    of Texas.</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Bolfing has been an instructor at TSTC for 10 years in the 
    Electrical/Computerized Control Systems &amp; Robotics department. As a Senior 
    Instructor at TSTC, he holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Technical Training 
    and Development from the University of Texas, as well as associate&#8217;s 
    degrees in Electrical Power Technology and Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning 
    and Refrigeration Technology from Texas State Technical College Waco.</p>
  <p align="left">He holds a Texas Master Electrical License and a Texas Air Conditioning 
    and Refrigeration Contractors License. His professional background includes 
    positions with Brown and Root Engineering, General Tire Company, Trane Company, 
    Lux Packaging, Waco Service Inc. and Texas State Technical College Waco. He 
    also serves as vice president of the Heart of Texas Old Car Club Inc.<br>

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Structures are an integral part of the overhead 
  delivery of electricity from generation to end user. Many factors influence 
  the type of structure that will be designed for a particular application. The 
  program will consist of presentations from representatives of the concrete, 
  fiberglass, and steel pole industries. The presentations will focus on the applications, 
  the advantages, and the limitations of the different types of structures used 
  through out the utility industry.</p>
