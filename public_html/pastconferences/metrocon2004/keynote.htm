  <p class=MsoNormal><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> Is the mechanism of &#8220;anti-gravity&#8221; 
    a closely held technology &#8230; where working devices will always be hidden 
    behind an impenetrable veil of secrecy, or is it part of an emerging new science 
    &#8230; where the tools and techniques now available for investigating matter 
    at the nanoscale are helping to refine our understanding of physics? Perhaps 
    it is simply part of a grand &#8220;thought experiment&#8221; &#8230; potentially 
    useful, but empirically not demonstrable?</p>
  <p>Although it has occupied some of the best minds of history, so far the force 
    we call gravity has revealed itself to us only slowly and reluctantly. Is 
    this force carried by waves? Can we explain its behavior using the familiar 
    particle-wave duality models of modern physics? Does it have an inverse counterpart? 
    Could such a thing as antigravity even exist?</p>
  <p> The forces of Nature do seem to have a symmetry associated with them. There 
    are North and South magnetic poles, positive and negative charges. Why not 
    both a gravity and an anti-gravity? </p>
  <p>&#8220;This phenomenon is general. Every particle in Nature has an amplitude 
    to move backwards in time, and therefore has an anti-particle.&#8221;<br>
    - Richard Feynman, &#8220;QED&#8221;</p>
  <p>Many papers have been published about experiments and devices which were 
    thought to exhibit an &#8220;antigravity&#8221; effect. But when attempts 
    were made to duplicate these machines and to verify the effects, they seem 
    to have ended in failure. Why is that? Is creating an antigravity device an 
    exercise in futility, or just a really hard engineering problem? </p>
  <p>Answering these questions is not easy. If you do a literature search, you 
    will find that there are those in the scientific community who propose an 
    alternative to Einstein&#8217;s &#8220;space-time curvature&#8221; theory 
    of gravity - one based on something called Zero-Point Energy (ZPE). The Russian 
    physicist and Nobel Prize winner Andrei Sakharov has been credited with suggesting 
    that there could be a link between gravity, inertia, and ZPE (a fluctuating 
    quantum force which has been claimed to explain the experimental results referred 
    to as &#8220;the Casimir effect.&#8221;)</p>
  <p>If ZPE exists, then perhaps antigravity does too. But where is the evidence? 
    The claims and counterclaims, the science and pseudoscience, the myth and 
    the reality &#8211; how can you know the truth? Who is right and who is wrong? 
    If the ZPE theory is correct, then why don&#8217;t we have over-unity devices 
    and antigravity machines?</p>
  <p>&#8220;&#8230; the four stages of response to any new and revolutionary development: 
    1. It&#8217;s crazy! 2. It may be possible-so what? 3. I said it was a good 
    idea all along. 4. I thought of it first.&#8221;<br>
    - Arthur C. Clarke</p>
  <p>Nick Cook takes us along with him on a fabulous journey as he attempts to 
    unravel the puzzle and answer these questions. Companions in a passionate 
    pursuit of engineering truth, we will get to share his experiences, understand 
    his frustrations, and reach our own conclusions based on the evidence as we 
    &#8220;&#8230;follow the data, theory be damned!&#8221;<br>

  <p class=MsoNormal><strong><u>Biography:</u></strong> &#8226; Nick Cook is an 
    award-winning Aerospace and Defence journalist with a career spanning over 
    20 years. A four-time winner of the prestigious Royal Aeronautical Society 
    Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award in the Defence, Business, Propulsion 
    and Technology categories, he has been a regular commentator on defence and 
    security issues. His views and analysis were sought by UK, US and other world 
    news media during the 1991 and 2003 wars against Iraq, and major conflicts 
    in between.</p>
  <p>&#8226; From 1987 to 2001, he was Aerospace Editor of Jane&#8217;s Defence 
    Weekly, the world&#8217;s leading International Defence Journal, after which 
    he became Key Representative of their Aerospace Consultancy. His impeccable 
    credentials have gained, and still gain him access to the world&#8217;s leading 
    defence establishments. During his career, he has visited numerous top secret 
    military bases in the US and former Soviet Union. Nick Cook&#8217;s groundbreaking, 
    exclusive stories forJane&#8217;s have included reports on Russian secret 
    weapons, a second classified operation to rescue US hostages in Iran and more 
    recently US defence industry involvement in anti-gravity technology. All made 
    headlines around the world.</p>
  <p>&#8226; Nick Cook is also a highly successful book author and documentary 
    film-maker. </p>
  <p>o His ground-breaking book The Hunt For Zero Point, published by Century 
    Random House in the UK in 2001 and Broadway Books in the US in 2002, details 
    his ten-year investigation into efforts to crack the Holy Grail of aerospace 
    propulsion: anti-gravity technology. The book reached No.1 in the Amazon.com 
    non-fiction chart and no.3 on the general list. </p>
  <p>o Other works by Cook include: Angel Archangel and Aggressor and a number 
    of ghost written books including The Sunday Times Bestseller Sabre Squadron.</p>
  <p>o His television credits include a two-hour documentary, written and presented 
    by him for The Discovery/Learning Channel, called Billion Dollar Secret which 
    detailed for the first time the secret inner workings of America&#8217;s classified 
    weapons establishment.</p>
  <p>&#8226; Cook has a degree in Arabic and Islamic Studies from Exeter University 
    and lives in London. He continues to be a regular contributor to the Financial 
    Times in London and writes extensively for other national and international 
    media.<br>
