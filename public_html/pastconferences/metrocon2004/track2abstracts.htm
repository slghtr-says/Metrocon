<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Dramatic improvements in healthcare and quality 
  of life have resulted from research and development that applied principles 
  and methods from the quantitative sciences to address biomedical problems. As 
  medical care continues to progress, research at spatial and temporal scales 
  not encompassed by traditional biomedical disciplines is necessary to create 
  significant advances. Biomedical research communities are well aware of the 
  need to encourage and support multi-disciplinary approaches to research and 
  development - approaches that will result from collaborations among disciplines 
  and organizations. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed opportunities 
  and programs to facilitate and support disciplinary and organizational partnerships 
  aimed at improving healthcare and medicine. This presentation discusses several 
  of these programs and related opportunities for research funding. Programs that 
  support the application of physical and engineering sciences to biology and 
  medicine are described along with trans-NIH opportunities through the Bioengineering 
  Consortium and Bioinformatics Consortium. Implications to investigators of the 
  NIH Roadmap Initiative on multidisciplinary research and public/private partnerships 
  is also discussed.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: A major segment of the research 
  done in drug delivery uses biodegradable polymers that are loaded with drugs 
  for slow, sustained release. These polymers usually have the format of microspheres 
  with a diameter on the order of 10&#8217;s to 100 um. Several years ago, our 
  lab developed the patent-pending method of extruding similar sized, drug-loaded, 
  biodegradable fibers at room temperature that will slowly release drugs. These 
  fibers have a number of important advantages over traditional microspheres such 
  as continuous as opposed to batch processing, much smaller surface to volume 
  ratio for a slower release, the ability of the fiber to have mechanical strength 
  (i.e., you can tie knots in it), it is surgically removable, and it can hold 
  a much larger drug load on a drug mass to polymer mass basis than the microspheres 
  used by most researchers. In addition, these fibers can be made into different 
  formats (e.g. they can be monofilament, hollow, water-filled, gel-filled, multi-layer 
  core-in-sheath, etc.). Each of these formats provides a unique capability not 
  found in other types of drug delivery modalities and provides a ready opportunity 
  to combine different types of polymer in the same fiber. Each type of polymer 
  can have different degradation rates, hence different drug release rates, and 
  each can be loaded with a different drug. Therefore, this technology makes possible 
  the delivery of different drugs, each with its own release kinetics from the 
  same fiber.</p>
<p>We report here the results of a gel-filled fiber, wherein the gel was loaded 
  with a beta-galactosidase adenovirus. This virus contains genetic material, 
  which if infected within a cell will induce the creation of a protein that can 
  be uniquely stained blue. Therefore, the extent of cell transfection can be 
  readily identified. These fibers were surgically implanted into a human pancreatic 
  tumor cell line that was implanted into immune-compromised mice. These tumors 
  were allowed to grow to a size of approximately 5 mm in diameter before our 
  fibers were implanted. The end result is that at the time of sacrifice, the 
  tumors had nearly all cells within 2-4mm of the fiber turn blue, indicating 
  that the virus successfully was loaded and released from the fiber with retained 
  biological activity. This now provides hope that therapeutic viruses can also 
  be loaded into our fibers with the end result being regression of a pancreatic 
  tumor.<br>

<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Aging and chronic diseases such as diabetes 
  result in problem wounds with impaired healing characteristics. These result 
  in long term suffering, prolonged hospitalizations, amputations and can be life 
  threatening. Approximately 15 years ago efforts began to bring together areas 
  of biotechnology and tissue engineering to develop new technologies and alternatives 
  to address these problems. A great deal has been learned since then especially 
  in the areas of tissue growth factors and in methods for growing and manufacturing 
  &#8220; tissue equivalents&#8221; which may be used for treatment of such problem 
  wounds. However, development of clinically useful technologies and products 
  has been slow. Only a few such products are emerging on the market and the numbers 
  of amputations required from problem wounds of diabetes continues to increase. 
  This presentation provides an overview of the biotechnology and tissue engineering 
  advances, current approaches, limitations and barriers, and potential new directions.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#000000"><u>Abstract</u>:</font></strong><font color="#000000"> 
  The original concept of the Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) developed at NASA&#8217;s 
  Johnson Space Center was to simulate the microgravity conditions of space in 
  order to model at the cellular level the effects of microgravity on the astronauts. 
  The principal used is to culture cells in a fluid-filled, zero headspace cylindrical 
  chamber rotated horizontally to suspend cells in a continuous state of free 
  fall with very low shear stress (&lt; 0.5 dynes/sq. cm). Oxygenation is accomplished 
  by diffusion through a silicone membrane on the back of the culture vessel or 
  running down the center. During the initial testing of the bioreactor, it was 
  observed that when dispersed cells were introduced into the vessel, they tended 
  to aggregate and form large three-dimensional structures that resembled the 
  tissues from which they were derived. Since then, a number of studies have confirmed 
  that assembling cells in three-dimensional structures using the RCCS technology 
  produced tissue analogs that were functionally very close to intact tissues 
  both at the cellular and molecular level. For basic science, the advantages 
  of this technology are obvious. For therapeutics, the possibilities for using 
  the RCCS for tissue engineering are vast. The development of the RCCS has continued 
  from its original concept of a simple rotating fluid-filled cylinder. For example, 
  we now have continuously perfused systems that better maintain normal physiological 
  conditions than the original batch culture devices. Nevertheless, there are 
  a number of areas in which engineering disciplines can interface with biology 
  to impact this technology:</font>
<p>1. Fluid Mechanics: Aggregation of cells is very sensitive to the movement 
  of the surrounding fluid. If there is too little aggregation, cells may undergo 
  apoptosis (programmed cell death). If there is too much aggregation, cells in 
  the center of the aggregates will die from lack of oxygen and nutrients. Analysis 
  of the effect of the shape of the culture vessel on the behavior of cells cultured 
  in the RCCS is needed.</p>
<p>2. Biomaterials: Most cells in the body exist in a complex extracellular matrix 
  environment which profoundly influences gene expression and tissue function. 
  The ability to synthesize materials which mimic the extracellular matrix will 
  be very important for producing tissues for therapeutic applications.</p>
<p>3. Sensors and control systems: In the body, the tissue environment is maintained 
  within very narrow limits. In cell culture systems, especially batch culture, 
  the environment can vary tremendously, causing stress to the cells. By developing 
  compact, robust sensors and control systems for the RCCS, it will be possible 
  to reduce tissue injury and improve the quality of the tissue-engineered product.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong><u>Biography</u></strong>: I did 
  my doctoral work at the Ohio State University in Biochemical Pharmacology. My 
  thesis involved the biochemistry and pharmacology of platelet aggregation. After 
  finishing at Ohio State, I did a post-doctoral fellowship at Baylor College 
  of Medicine in the Cardiovascular Sciences Section of the Department of Medicine. 
  My work involved the role of the sodium/potassium pump in vascular contractility 
  and smooth muscle growth. At the end of my post-doctoral fellowship I joined 
  the facility in Cardiovascular Sciences and studied the regulation of vascular 
  smooth muscle by adrenergic receptors. During my time at Baylor, I had an opportunity 
  to visit NASA engineers and scientists who were developing what they called 
  the Rotating Wall Vessel. When two of the developers left NASA to form Synthecon 
  to commercialize the system which is now known as the Rotary Cell Culture System 
  (RCCS), I joined them to help develop new applications.</font>

  Development and function of living organisms involve biomechanical events arising 
  primarily form interactions of cellular components with the extracellular matrix, 
  the major component of living organisms. These interactions, now recognized 
  as mechano-signaling, transmitted by the cellular cytoskeleton, culminate in 
  gene expression changes. Such mutual dependence is reflected in unique organization 
  of a number of tissues that is essential for their function. Thus an understanding 
  of normal state and pathological conditions of tissues demands multidisciplinary 
  approaches that are particularly evident in tissue engineering.</font>
<p>Our involvement in mechanical aspects of tissue biology began with the construction 
  of 3-dimensional in vitro models of human tissue&#8211;Tissue Equivalents. This 
  &#8220;Tissue Engineering&#8221; concept incorporates normal human cells into 
  collagen type I architecture to produce living models the skin and the cornea. 
  The unique properties of our design are optical translucency and dimensional 
  stability. Translucency allows observation of cellular morphology, movement, 
  and viability by variety of methods. The consequence of dimensional stability 
  Tissue Equivalents a perfect model for studies of tissue contraction, which 
  ideally closes a wound, but when poorly controlled, result in debilitating scar 
  formation.</p>
<p>Measurement of tissue contraction and direct real time observations of cellular

  Accommodation is the dynamic ability of the eye to change focus. It occurs as 
  a result of changes in the surface curvatures of the crystalline lens. The force 
  from ciliary muscle contraction is transduced by the zonules to the equator 
  of the lens to induce the required lenticular surface changes. The ciliary muscle 
  is approximately one tenth the size of the crystalline lens and can only generate 
  a total force of 1.6 grams. The mechanism by which this small muscle can produce 
  accommodation has significant practical implications.</font>
