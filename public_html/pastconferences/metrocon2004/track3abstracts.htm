<p align="center"><strong><font color="#0033FF" size="+2">Covert Channels and 
  Steganography: Detecting and Exploiting Uncertainty</font></strong><br>
  <font size="+1"><strong>Dr. Deepa Kundur, Texas A&amp;M University<br>
  8:30 -9:30</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: This two-part talk provides an introduction 
  to the fields of covert channels and steganography. A covert channel is an unintended 
  and/or unauthorized communications path that can be used to transfer data in 
  a manner that violates one or more security policies. We review the basic characteristics 
  of such channels highlighting classical methods that exploit uncertainty and 
  shared resources in computer systems to establish covert links. In the second 
  part of the talk, the problem of steganography of is introduced. Steganography 
  is the art of hiding the existence of a message in another medium. Several defining 
  features and applications of steganographic systems are considered. The talk 
  concludes with a discussion of how covert channels can be exploited with the 
  use of steganography for both system attack and advantage.</p>

  of Tactical Laser Weapons</font></strong><br>
  <strong><font size="+1">Dr. Mike I. Jones, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company</font><br>
  <font size="+1"><strong>9:45 -10:4</strong>5</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: The inspiring and memorable fiction of Buck 
  Rogers and Star Trek is nearing reality at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company's 
  Fort Worth plant. Lockheed Martin engineers are busily developing the world's 
  first fighter-based high-energy laser weapon, suitable for a variety of high-performance 
  platforms. Integration of a solid state laser weapon is a formidable engineering 
  challenge, involving literally every aircraft subsystem including electrical 
  power, propulsion, thermal management, aerodynamics, flight controls, structural 
  design, mechanical design, avionics systems, and pilot/vehicle interface, as 
  well as extensive flight simulation development and training. Mike I. Jones 
  is the LM Aero Technical Fellow in Electro-Optics, and will make a short presentation 
  today on integration of high-energy laser systems on tactical fighter aircraft.</p>
<p><strong><u>Biography</u></strong>: Mike I. Jones has functioned as lead optical 
  engineer for several Lockheed aircraft programs involving large-aperture, high-resolution 
  reconnaissance camera systems. He has performed complete on-site depot-level 
  lens disassembly, cleaning, reassembly and realignment for these cameras. Mike 
  has worked for three years in the flight simulation laboratory (FSL). He designed 
  and assembled optical projection systems for flight simulator domes and designed 
  optics for the wide angle collimating (WAC) stations now marketed by the Evans 
  &amp; Sutherland Co. Mike has also designed and managed construction and assembly 
  of two FSL wide-angle raster heads-up displays (HUD&#8217;s) and a variable-focus 
  zoom HUD for the A-12 program. <br>
  <br>
  Mike originated and developed the external visual display (EVD) for the National 
  Aerospace Plane (NASP) aircraft as well as participated in several NASP reconnaissance 
  system studies. He developed the canopy optical deviation correction equations 
  now utilized in all F-16 C/D aircraft to align HUD symbology to the exterior 
  visual scene. Mike is also the principle author of OASYS, Lockheed Martin Aero&#8217;s 
  in-house optical design program and the AIRWAVE and HEL-P codes for aero-adaptive 
  optical analysis and high energy laser propagation, as well as over a hundred 
  optical analysis and design programs for IR windows, aircraft transparencies, 
  and visual/IR signature reduction. <br>
  <br>
  In other work, Mike developed low-observable RF-absorbing EO turrets for internally 
  mounted EO/IR sensors. Some of his RF-absorbing window technologies have been 
  adopted by Lockheed Martin Electronics &amp; Missiles and BAE- Sanders for EO 
  system windows and have been implemented on UAV, F-22 and F-35 aircraft. He 
  designed the focusing/re-imaging optical system for the Project LightSpeed laser 
  manufacturing robotic head, and a similar robotic head for Sandia National Laboratories. 
  Finally, Mike has served as the Optics I and II instructor for the LM-FW Engineering 
  Leadership Development Program in-plant college-credit courses, and was awarded 
  Instructor of the Year by the class of 1999-2000. He also teaches the Optical 
  Modeling section of the EO 101 classes and completed three share sessions for 
  LM-Aero personnel on CFD-based aero-optical analysis. <br>
  <br>
  Mike's current assignments include working with directed Energy optical technology 
  - high energy laser (HEL) systems, atmospheric propagation, flow field aero-optics, 
  HEL beam control, electro-optical acquisition, tracking and pointing systems, 
  applications to F-35 canopy optical deviation measurements. He also consults 
  as needed on F-16, F-22, F-22X, F-35 and classified aircraft development programs. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Mike holds a number of patents including classified patent No. 5,174,649, &quot;Optical 
  Device and Method&quot;, Patent No. 6,439,751, &quot;Method and System for Transmitting 
  Light Through a Composite Skin&quot;, and a Patent pending for &quot;New Method 
  and System for Aircraft Canopy Optical Deviation Measurements&quot;. In his 
  spare time, Mike has consulted on the low-resolution Marcario spectrographic 
  system for the Hobby-Eberly telescope at McDonald Observatory, performed as 
  optical designer for the solar spectrum projector (SSP) system at the new McDonald 
  Observatory Visitor's Center, performed as optical designer for new Public Viewing 
  Lens for 107&quot; telescope at McDonald Observatory, and designed the Cassegrain 
  focal reducer lens for the 36&#8221; aperture George Observatory at Brazos Bend 
  State Park. Mike serves on the Industry Advisory Board for Texas Tech University 
  and has served as session chair for the 33rd AIAA Plasmadynamics and Lasers 
  Conference and was invited speaker for the AFOSR 2002 Program on Turbulence 
  and Rotating Flows.</p>

  <strong><font color="#0033FF" size="+2">Quantum Ensemble Computing</font></strong><br>
  <strong><font size="+1">Dr. Doug Matzke, Lawrence Technologies, LLC<br>
  11 :00 -12:00</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Interest in quantum computation started growing 
  significantly since 1994 when Peter Shor showed that quantum computers could 
  solve some problems such as factoring, faster than classical computers. This 
  capability is possible because quantum computers represent information state 
  differently than classical computers. This talk will present a new set of tools 
  and concepts that can be used explore this complex yet captivating topic.</p>
<p>Lawrence Technologies is building a quantum computing tool set/library under 
  Air Force contract that allows plug and play exploration of quantum computing 
  models described as circuits. Besides the traditional quantum operations, we 
  have designed this library to implement quantum ensembles. With this infrastructure 
  in place, the topic of quantum ensembles can be expanded to include the unintuitive 
  properties of Correlithm Objects. Correlithm Objects Theory is based on mathematical 
  modeling of neural systems and has lead to numerous patents. I will discuss 
  the Quantum ensemble and Correlithm Objects research, tools and results.</p>
<p><strong><u>Biography</u></strong>: Douglas Matzke earned his PhD in Electrical 
  Engineering from UT Dallas in May 2002 in the topic area of quantum computation. 
  Since then he has won two SBIR contracts to build Quantum Ensemble Computing 
  tools for the Air Force. This work is being performed at Lawrence Technologies, 
  LLC (<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.lt.com','LT','')">www.LT.com</a>). 
  Doug previously worked at Texas Instruments for more than 25 years. In 1992 
  and 1994 he was chairman of the PhysComp92 and PhysComp94 conferences. His long 
  term interest in the limits of computation is the common tie that knits all 
  these topic areas together. Doug has previously presented at Metrocon and other 
  IEEE Society meetings and is a thought provoking speaker.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0033FF" size="+2"><strong>Model Driven Architecture 
  &#8211; the Future of Software?</strong></font><br>
  <font size="+1"><strong>Dr. Frank Coyle, Southern Methodist University<br>
  1:30-3:00</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is a bold 
  initiative by the OMG to bring the two major aspects of software development 
  &#8211; design and code, closer together. The basic premise behind MDA, is that 
  by adding semantic information to familiar UML models, it&#8217;s possible to 
  build working systems without the pain and suffering of code development. At 
  least that&#8217;s the theory.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we&#8217;ll explore the ideas behind MDA, tracing its 
  roots to the early Shlaer-Mellor models. We&#8217;ll explore how the new UML 
  2.0 specification opens the door to new family of specification languages that 
  support MDA notions of Platform Independent Models (PIMs) from which working 
  systems can be generated. Along the way we&#8217;ll also make sense of the alphabet 
  soup of acronyms associated with MDA including MOF, XMI, CWM and JMI. </p>
<p><strong><u>Biography</u></strong>: Frank Coyle is on the faculty of the Computer 
  Science and Engineering Department at Southern Methodist University where he 
  is Director of the Software Engineering Program.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><font color="#0033FF" size="+2">Information Dissemination 
  in Mobile and Pervasive Environments</font></strong><br>
  <font size="+1"><strong>Dr. Mohan Kumar, University of Texas at Arlington<br>
  3<font size="+1">:15 -4:45</font></strong></font></p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>: Mobile and pervasive computing has the potential 
  to dramatically change the way we use computing devices and the Internet today. 
  Pervasive Computing applications require continual and autonomous availability 
  of &#8216;what you want&#8217; and `how you want&#8217; type of data in a proactive, 
  unobtrusive way. However, it is a challenge to disseminate information in such 
  environments due to the heterogeneity, unevenness and dynamicity associated. 
  In addition, the limitations of low resource pervasive devices (e.g., sensors, 
  pocket PCs, mobile phones, laptops, etc.) and networks (e.g., wireless) exacerbate 
  the situation. In this talk, we investigate effective use of such enhancing 
  techniques as caching, prefetching, and broadcasting to make requisite information 
  available to users. Software agents and profiling are used to ensure information 
  availability proactively at users&#8217; devices. Prototype systems are developed 
  by our group at CSE@UTA through grants from the NSF and the Texas ARP funds.</p>
